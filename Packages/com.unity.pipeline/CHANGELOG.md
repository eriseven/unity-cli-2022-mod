## [0.5.0-exp.1] - 2026-08-10

- New `GET /api/progress` endpoint: the currently executing command's task progress, served off the main thread so it answers even while a long synchronous command has the Editor blocked. Command authors report via the new `CliProgress.Report(title, info, current, total, progress)` API (thread-safe, callable from a blocked main thread) or the `CliEditorProgress.DisplayProgressBar` drop-in wrappers around `EditorUtility.DisplayProgressBar`; running `UnityEditor.Progress` items are mirrored automatically. Consumed by the `unity` CLI to render live terminal progress bars during `unity command` / `unity run --command`. (CLI-488, coordinated with CLI-335)
- Detached command jobs (CLI-335): `POST /api/exec` with `"job": true` returns a job id immediately and runs the command in the background — poll `GET /api/job?id=…` for state, live progress, and the retained result, so a client can reattach and collect the outcome after its own HTTP timeout. `POST /api/job/cancel` cancels a queued job outright and requests cooperative cancellation of a running one (long-running command/eval code can check the new public `PipelineCancellation` API). Results are retained for 1 hour / last 100 jobs; jobs do not survive domain reloads.
- The `eval` timeout cap is raised from 30 seconds to 24 hours (CLI-335) — long evaluations are legitimate now that clients can set custom timeouts or detach and reattach.
- The HTTP server now processes requests concurrently: an in-flight `/api/exec` command no longer blocks every other request (`/api/status` probes and `/api/progress` polls answer immediately, so a busy Editor no longer looks unreachable during a long command). Command execution itself is still strictly serialized — one `/api/exec` at a time, queued in arrival order, exactly as before. (CLI-335)
- Hardening for the above: a command's own timeout (not a fixed 60s) now governs how long `/api/exec` waits for it, `editor_status`/`test_status` queue behind the same exec gate instead of racing an in-flight command, and progress/job state is owned per server instance so a test server can never cross-attribute progress or job cancellation with the live server. Detached jobs are capped at 100 queued/running at once — further submissions get `429` until some finish. (CLI-335)
- Fix `executedAt` being returned as the zero-value instead of the actual execution time for `eval`/`eval_file`, `hot-reload`, and `run_tests`/`test_status`.
- New `audit` / `audit_status` commands: start a Project Auditor static-analysis scan and poll it, producing a CSV of the reported issues (`Category, Severity, Areas, Description, RelativePath, Line, DescriptorId, Recommendation`) for a client or coding agent to act on. Project Auditor is reached by reflection, so the package still compiles and runs in Editors without it, and `--categories` works against both its deployments. An Editor whose Project Auditor has no analysis rules — in a built-in-module Editor these ship in the separate `com.unity.project-auditor-rules` package — reports `unavailable` and names the package to install, rather than an empty scan that reads as a clean project.
- [UUM-148802] Fix `get_console_logs`/`clear_console` and `console` silently losing all console capture after exiting Play Mode (recovering only on the next recompile): re-subscribe to Unity's log callback on every play-mode transition instead of only once at domain load.
- [UUM-148605] Persist `set_autotick`'s enabled/interval state in SessionState so it survives a domain reload instead of silently turning itself off after every recompile. Add a `persist` flag (default `true`) to opt a one-off/expensive setting (e.g. `interval_ms=0`) out of that persistence.
- Emit a busy/settling signal while the Editor is still importing/compiling after the server starts (cold project import), instead of letting early commands fail with an opaque null-data envelope. `/api/status` reports `settling` (withholding `ready`) until the Editor is first seen idle, and `/api/exec` rejects main-thread commands during that window with HTTP 503 and a structured envelope (`error: "Server Busy"`, `status: "busy"`, `retryable: true`). Background commands (e.g. `recompile_status`, `package_status`, `console`) and `editor_status` stay servable so callers can observe progress. The gate is scoped to the editor session's initial settle window: warm starts settle immediately, and servers recreated by domain reloads or started during mid-session imports/compiles never re-arm it. (AUTHAPI-35)
- [UUM-149016] Fix `InvalidOperationException`s logged after running `run_tests` more than once: a stale `TestResultCollector` left registered with Unity's TestRunnerApi kept receiving later runs' completion notifications and re-completed its own already-completed result.

## [0.4.0-exp.1] - 2026-07-23
- Persist the pipeline server auth token across editor domain reloads so long-lived clients (MCP/IDE) no longer get `401` after a recompile. (CLI-412)
- `capture_game_view` gains a `source` parameter: `camera` (default, unchanged) or `screen`. `source=screen` captures the composited game view backbuffer so Screen Space - Overlay UI (HUDs, menus) is included — the camera path never sees overlay canvases. Screen capture requires Play Mode; in Edit Mode it returns a clear error. (AUTHAPI-10)
- `capture_game_view`/`capture_scene_view` with `save_path` now return a path-only result (no base64) so agent tool results stay small; pass `include_inline_image=true` for the old behavior. Add `max_resolution` to cap the inline image size. (AUTHAPI-8)
- Object-reference string handles now accept authoring-root-relative asset paths (e.g. `Materials/Floor.mat`, not just `Assets/Materials/Floor.mat`): a relative string with a file extension is treated as an asset path and normalized under the authoring root, and a failed lookup now reports every strategy tried instead of a misleading hierarchy-path-only error. (AUTHAPI-9)
